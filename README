ical2html takes an iCalendar file and outputs an HTML file showing one
or more months in the form of tables. Requires libical.

    0. Compiling from source
    1. Downloading and compiling from CVS
    2. Updating to the latest CVS version
    3. Command line options
    4. Style sheet (calendar.css)
    


0) Compiling from source
------------------------

Download and unpack the ical2html-XXX.tar.gz file (where XXX is the
version number), go into the ical2html-XXX directory and type:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

You may want to run ./configure --help first, to see what options are
available. Or read INSTALL for general information about the configure
process.


1) Compiling from CVS
---------------------

First get the sources, begin by setting up CVS:

    $ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public
    $ export CVSROOT
    $ cvs login

When prompted for a password, enter "anonymous" (without the
quotes). Then let CVS download the sources:

    $ cvs get Ical2html

Then configure and compile. This requires automake and autoconf to be
installed:

    $ cd Ical2html
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If "configure" complains about "libical", look for libical-dev or
libical in the software repository for your operating system, or
download it from http://softwarestudio.org/libical/ or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeassociation/. Ical2html was
developed with libical versions 0.43 and 1.0.

Debian 5.0 (Lenny)
    The version of libical in Debian Lenny is 0.31 and doesn't work
    with ical2html. But the libical from Debian Backports
    (http://www.backports.org/) does.

Max OS X
    If you installed libical from MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/),
    you'll need to tell configure where the header files and libraries
    are. Run configure as follows (all on one line):

    CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/libical
    -L/opt/local/lib" ./configure

If you managed to compile, but the program fails to run with an error
about "libical.so" not found, try to set the variable
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" before running ical2html, e.g.:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib ical2html


2) Updating to the latest CVS version
-------------------------------------

If you have a version of ical2html already and want to update it to
the latest version:

    $ cd Ical2html
    $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public update

If you are asked for a password, answer "anonymous"


3) [Explain ical2html options]
------------------------------

4) [Explain that the created HTML file links to "calendar.css"]
---------------------------------------------------------------

[An example "calendar.css" in included]
