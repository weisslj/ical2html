ical2html takes an iCalendar file and outputs an HTML file showing one
or more months in the form of tables. Requires libical.

    0. Compiling from source
    1. Downloading and compiling from CVS
    2. Updating to the latest CVS version
    3. Command line options
    4. Style sheet (calendar.css)
    


0) Compiling from source
------------------------

Download and unpack the ical2html-XXX.tar.gz file (where XXX is the
version number), go into the ical2html-XXX directory and type:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

You may want to run ./configure --help first, to see what options are
available. Or read INSTALL for general information about the configure
process.


1) Compiling from CVS
---------------------

First get the sources, begin by setting up CVS:

    $ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public
    $ export CVSROOT
    $ cvs login

When prompted for a password, enter "anonymous" (without the
quotes). Then let CVS download the sources:

    $ cvs get Ical2html

Then configure and compile. This requires automake and autoconf to be
installed:

    $ cd Ical2html
    $ aclocal
    $ autoheader
    $ automake -a
    $ autoconf
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If "configure" complains about "libical", download it from http://softwarestudio.org/libical/ If you have libical already, but "configure" can't find it, try adding CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, e.g., like this:

    $ CPPFLAGS=-I/home/bert/include LDFLAGS=-L/home/bert/lib ./configure

If you managed to compile, but the program fails to run with an error
about "libical.so" not found, try one of the following: (1) either
uncomment the line with "-static" in Makefile.am and then start again
from "automake -a" above; or (2) set the variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
before running ical2html, e.g.:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/bert/lib ical2html


2) Updating to the latest CVS version
-------------------------------------

If you have a version of ical2html already and want to update it to
the latest version:

    $ cd Ical2html
    $ cvs up -d


2) [Explain ical2html options]
------------------------------

3) [Explain that the created HTML file links to "calendar.css"]
---------------------------------------------------------------

[An example "calendar.css" in included]
