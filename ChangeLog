	* icalmerge.c: Mac OS X has no search.h and apparently a broken
	search() function in libc, so now icalmerge has its own hsearch
	implementation.

	* icalmerge.c: added icalmerge program to merge icalendar files,
	keeping only the most recent version of each event. Added some
	files with routines that might be absent on some platforms
	(realloc.c, malloc.c, search-freebsd.h) and up[dated configure.in
	correspondingly.

	* ical2html.c: fixed a NULL pointer bug; replaced a wrong function
	call (needed the class as a string, not as an int)

	* Makefile.am: removed -static, since Mac OS X doesn't like it.

	* icalfilter.c: now uses strerror() instead of sys_errlist, since
	gcc3 says the latter is deprecated.

	* ical2html.c: now stops *before* the end time instead of on it,
	because a full-day event may end on 00:00 of the next day.

	* icalfilter.c: replaced sys_errlist[] by strerror(), to make
	compilation on HP-UX easier.

	* Added copies of GNU getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h to the
	distribution and a rule in configure.in that uses them when there
	is no getopt_long() in the system libraries.

	* Development started.
