	* icalfilter.c: now uses strerror() instead of sys_errlist, since
	gcc3 says the latter is deprecated.

	* ical2html.c: now stops *before* the end time instead of on it,
	because a full-day event may end on 00:00 of the next day.

	* Added copies of GNU getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h to the
	distribution and a rule in configure.in that uses them when there
	is no getopt_long() in the system libraries.

	* Development started.
