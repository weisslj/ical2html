	* ical2html.c: Thanks to David Rysdam <drysdam at ll.mit.edu>, it
	is now possible to include the LOCATION field in the output,
	controlled by option -l. The mark-up for the optional DESCRIPTION
	chnaged as a result and the default style sheet (calendar.css) has
	been updated.

2010-03-18  Bert Bos  <bert@Europa.local>

	* Released version 2.0, see http://www.w3.org/Tools/Ical2html/

2010-01-28  Bert Bos  <bert@sophia.w3.org>

	* Now using libical 0.43-2~bpo50+1 (from Debian Backports)

2009-02-22  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* Now using libical 0.43

2003-07-31  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* Released version 0.4

	* ical2html.c: There is no routine for making an icaltime from a
	year, month and date and writing to the struct is not safe, so now
	it constructs an icaltime by creating a string YYYYMMDD and
	parsing it. It's still fast enough. Also added option --timezone,
	since libical doesn't look at the TZ environment variable.

	* icalfilter.c: Used a different routine from libical to get class
	converted to a string, the old one was apparently not the correct
	one to use, since it returned NULL.

	* icalmerge.c: Mac OS X has no search.h and apparently a broken
	search() function in libc, so now icalmerge has its own hsearch
	implementation.

2003-07-30  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* icalmerge.c: added icalmerge program to merge icalendar files,
	keeping only the most recent version of each event. Added some
	files with routines that might be absent on some platforms
	(realloc.c, malloc.c, search-freebsd.h) and up[dated configure.in
	correspondingly.

2003-07-09  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* ical2html.c: fixed a NULL pointer bug; replaced a wrong function
	call (needed the class as a string, not as an int)

	* Makefile.am: removed -static, since Mac OS X doesn't like it.

2003-05-01  Bert Bos  <bert@bert>

	* icalfilter.c: now uses strerror() instead of sys_errlist, since
	gcc3 says the latter is deprecated.

	* ical2html.c: now stops *before* the end time instead of on it,
	because a full-day event may end on 00:00 of the next day.

2003-02-18  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* icalfilter.c: replaced sys_errlist[] by strerror(), to make
	compilation on HP-UX easier.

2003-01-17  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

	* Added copies of GNU getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h to the
	distribution and a rule in configure.in that uses them when there
	is no getopt_long() in the system libraries.

2002-09-28  Bert Bos  <bert@bert.inria.fr>

	* Development started.
